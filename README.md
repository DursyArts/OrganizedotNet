Made this while i was bored. Basic CRUD operations for notes. Saving notes as JSON file.

## Features:
- Note have a Note Header, Note Text and Note ID.
- Create notes
- Read notes
- Update notes
- Delete notes
- Save/Load notes

## For the future (mainly for me, so i cant forgor)
- Use SQL, either MySQL or local SQLite table for saving and loading
- Add Tab to save Links, basically Bookmarks.
- Make it look better
- Auto focus the Note Header and Tab should focus always that too
- More Note metadata
